# Software Architectures Playground
This repository showcases implementations of four distinct software architectures (Monolithic, Client-Server, Microservices, Layered) within a React application. The primary goal of this project is to facilitate the exploration and comparison of different architectural structures in a practical and cohesive context.

## Description

Within this repository, you will find a React application serving as a canvas to demonstrate the application of four essential software architectures. The objective is to provide a hands-on understanding of how these architectures can be implemented and their impact on the development and maintenance of an application.

## Implemented Architectures

### 1. Monolithic Software Architecture
In the monolithic implementation, the entire application is built as a single unit. Explore how this structure simplifies development while learning about its challenges in terms of scalability and maintenance.

### 2. Client-Server Software Architecture
The Client-Server architecture divides responsibilities between the client (user interface) and the server (logic and data). Discover how this separation facilitates scalability and allows greater flexibility in development.

### 3. Microservices Software Architecture
With the Microservices architecture, the application is divided into independent services that communicate with each other. Investigate how this division enhances scalability, flexibility, and resilience, while also posing challenges in terms of complexity.

### 4. Layered Software Architecture
Layered architecture organizes the application into layers, each with a specific responsibility. Explore how this structure improves code modularity and maintainability.

## Live Demo
A live demo of this project is available at [here](https://architectures.vercel.app/).
